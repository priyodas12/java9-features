Onwards java9 G1 will be default garbage collector.

Low latency(The period of time during which the garbage collector is active)

High throughput(Throughput is the percentage of total time not spent in garbage collection,
considered over long periods of time) garbage Collectors.

pause target of 200ms.(this time indicates garbage collectors stops
the application and recovers space that is no longer used)

G1 Garbage collector splits heap area into regions(roughly number of 2048)
region size 1-32MB.

if its 4GB heap size=4*1024MB=2MB of region size.
if its 8GB heap size=8*1024MB=4MB of region size.

regions are tagged as Eden,Survivor,Old & Humongous(any object size is half of the region)

new object allocated to Eden regions.

concurrent mark operation while java application will not stop.
